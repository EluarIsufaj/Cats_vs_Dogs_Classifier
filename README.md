# Cats vs Dogs Image Classifier

This is a mini project demonstrating image classification using TensorFlow and Keras. The model classifies images as cats or dogs using a simple convolutional neural network.

## Features

- Custom CNN with 3 convolutional layers and dense layers
- Trained on a labeled dataset of cat and dog images
- Uses image preprocessing techniques
- Early stopping to avoid overfitting

## Training

- The model was trained for 6 epochs on Google Colab with limited computational resources.
- Achieved approximately 95% training accuracy and 82% validation accuracy.

## Usage

- Load your dataset organized in folders by class.
- Train the model using the provided training script.
- Save and load the trained model for inference on new images.

## Notes

This project is a starting point to learn CNNs and TensorFlow workflows, with potential for further refinement and scaling.
